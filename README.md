The primary datasets are:
- ``train_full.txt``
- ``train_sub.txt``
- ``train_noisy.txt``
- ``validation.txt``


### Codes

- ``classification.py``

	* Contains the ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` class. Contains ``train()`` and ``predict()`` methods.


- ``eval.py``

	* Contains the skeleton code for the ``Evaluator`` class. Contains ``confusion_matrix()``, ``accuracy()``, ``precision()``, ``recall()``, and ``f1_score()`` methods.
